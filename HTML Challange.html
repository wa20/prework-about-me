<h4>One Night in Miami</h4>
<p><strong>Muhammed Ali vs Sonny Liston</strong> - In late 1963, Ali had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Although Ali was the underdog in the fight he beat Liston delivering a knockout blow in the 6th round. Liston was saved by the bell but did not answer the 7th round bell declaring Ali as the winner. It has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he "took a dive" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch.</p>

              <p><strong>Outkast</strong> was an American hip hop duo formed in 1992 in East Point, Georgia, 
                consisting of Atlanta-based rappers Andre "3000" Benjamin (formerly known as Dre) and 
                Antwan "Big Boi" Patton. Widely recognized for their intricate lyricism, 
                memorable melodies and positive messages, OutKast is often regarded as one of the greatest and 
                most influential hip hop duos of all time. The duo achieved both critical acclaim and 
                commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize 
                Southern hip hop while experimenting with diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno.</p>

        <li><strong>Choose a good bread </strong> - Start with an unsliced loaf of ciabatta or another type, of your choosing. Pre-sliced bread gets too soggy too fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Grab your condiments</strong> - After cutting the ciabatta loaf lengthwise, smear mustard on the bottom slice. But not just any mustard, a well-rounded mustard because it works best with the meat to come. Skip the creamy spreads as they can dull the flavor of the other ingredients. A good mustard, will add richness without competition. You will taste it best when it is on the bottom as it is closest to your taste buds.</li>
        <li><strong>Stack up the meat and cheese</strong> - On top of the mustard goes the meat: pastrami, roast beef, ham etc.. or cured meats, take your pick. layering on a good, aged Swiss. Use no more than a 1:4 ratio of cheese to meat because, like the mayo, the creaminess of cheese can mute flavor. A little bit of aged cheese goes a long way. </li>
        <li><strong>Add your veggies</strong> - Shingle on thinly sliced tomatoes and red onions (marinate the raw onions in salt, pepper, olive oil and red wine vinegar for about 5 minutes to bring out taste). The cheese underneath keeps the veggies from sliding around and the wide meat layer stops the bread from getting soggy. The loose-leaf lettuce (or one of these other varieties) added next, on top of the tomatoes and onions, also keeps the bread above dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Put it alltogether</strong> - Smear mayonnaise on the top bread slice and then add the top of the bread and press the sandwich together. </li>
